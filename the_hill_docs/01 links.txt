Its a private school site and information siteÂ really.

You can use these 3 links as reference sites.
Heritage and Georges in terms of general aesthetics and lusatania not too big about 
their website but their tabs and information is packaged well in some spaces


https://www.theheritageschool.net/

https://www.stgeorges.co.zw

https://lusitaniaprimary.co.zw/
This one not to happy with the aesthetics but they package (group) their tabs nicely
